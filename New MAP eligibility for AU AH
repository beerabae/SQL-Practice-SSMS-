Topic : Parameter query for New MAP Eligibility. 
Issue : Even though AU AH has AFSL but still can't use map -> probably because of program restriction
Solution : Check which program (which level  ? - balance program or anyother level ? ) has restriction on New MAP parameter. 
           Also, check what is the parameter ID of New MAP ? And understand what is parameter. what is the entity type and entity id. 
          This is the most confusing thing for me so far.
